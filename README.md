# Database Management System (DBMS)

A DBMS is a software platform that is designed to store, retrieve, and update data 
in a computer system. I decided to implement my version in Java. 
Below are some examples of functionality that my implementation supports:

* Create a table
* Describe a table
* Insert record into table
* Delete record from table
* Search for record in table (Query)
* Drop a table

## Getting Started

IDE or visit this [link](https://dnikolic.weebly.com/side-projects.html) to see a video 
I have created that demonstrates the project.
